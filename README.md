# ScrubContacts

*This Python Web Application helps you to fast clean your Google Contacts in a fast and safe way.*

It is still under development and this source code is provides just because it works while connecting to Google Contacts for retrieving contacts data and handle that. If you turn around you won't find it working in any other places because people are too lazy to explain that.

##How it works:
This software would merge duplicated contacts by name, e-mail and phone number. It also provides features to batch rename contacts, format phones and e-mail addresses. There are many APIs you can use as you wish.

## How to install:
1.) Put app.py and templates directory in your host computer or server.

2.) Change settings.cfg file to fit your GoogleApps Account ID.

3.) If you don't know what is step 2, you must have a look at this: https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/google

## How to run:
After installing ScrubContacts into your host computer:

1.) Go to the directory where you placed that and run it with 'python app.py'.

2.) Go to your web browser, login with the Google Contacts' Account you want to clean up.

3.) Call your host URL from browser's address bar, authorize the Scrub Contacts Application for the first time.

4.) Go to your host console (that one where you called python command line) and see the magic happens.

**Other options:**

- Source code has many sample codes inside there.

- When you start the application a menu will be displayed with many test options. It could help you to understand how it works in this alpha stage.

## Warning

This software is provided as is, so use it at your own risk.

It will damage your Google Contacts Data messing up your contacts if you don't use carefully. So create a CSV Backup BEFORE to use that!

Source code is available here, so if you are unsatisfied, improve it yourself.

I would be happy to have your collaboration on this project.

Thanks for understanding.
